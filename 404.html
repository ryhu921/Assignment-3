<!-- This code is used for solving the 404 error problem when launching the live link on github. For some reason,
when launching the website from the live link, the homepage is not able to direct to any other pages, showing a 404
error. We've searched for solutions online and this one finally worked. We've copied this code directly from a Github
community discussion page and have provided a link for reference below. We are not too sure the cause of this error
but we've found a temporary solution for it.
